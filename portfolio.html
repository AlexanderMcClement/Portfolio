                    I'm Alexander C McClement or Alex for short. I currently work at Google Maps as a private
                    contractor.
                    In my spare time I play Magic The Gathering Arena, watch Anime/Netflix, Or hang out with on of my
                    girlfriend 3
                    cats Bean, Vinnie or Spooky.
                    The reason I join this boot camp was to advance my skills and go further after what I want.
                    My ultimate long term go is no only vist but climb K2. I also love spice food and done the blazing
                    wings
                    challenege twice.

                    As for my anime craziness. I love the animes I can relate to main character
                    or see my as. Naturo is great but I've always consider my self more of Saki or Itachi. Same goes for
                    Fate I'm
                    the bane of my sword. I relate to things out side of life because well it let me retreat into
                    something when it
                    becomes to much.
                    Ultimately I never found something bet the Neon Gensis Evegelion. I'm Shinji in every way and still
                    try to
                    impress my family.
